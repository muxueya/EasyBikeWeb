# Cycling Adventure

Welcome to the **Cycling Adventure**, a fun and interactive browser game where you avoid obstacles, collect hearts, and keep biking! The game allows you to select different difficulty levels and track your distance as you dodge various obstacles along the way.

## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Easy, Medium, and Hard modes, each with a different set of obstacles and challenges.
- **Obstacle Types**: Rocks, Rabbits, and Pedestrians that you need to dodge to keep your hearts.
- **Power-Ups**: Collect flowers to regain hearts and find magic balls to become temporarily invisible.
- **Responsive Design**: The game adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal gameplay.
- **Endless Scrolling**: The background continuously scrolls as you progress in the game.

## Controls

- Use the left (`←`) and right (`→`) arrow keys or the corresponding buttons on the screen to move the bike and dodge obstacles.
- If you collide with an obstacle, you lose hearts based on the difficulty of the obstacle.
- Collect flowers to regain hearts when your hearts are low (below 5).
- Look for magic balls that make you temporarily invisible and immune to obstacles.
